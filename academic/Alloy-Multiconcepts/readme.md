A library for Alloy to use multisets and multirelations in Alloy model, including:

* `mset.als` - A parametric module to declare a multiset
* `mrel.als` - A parametric module to declare a multirelation
* `multi.als` - A utility module provides operations over multisets and multirelations

File `story.als` includes the a seasonal sale bundling model described in the paper [Modeling and Reasoning with Multirelations, and their encoding in Alloy](http://oclworkshop.github.io/2016/papers/OCL16_paper_10.pdf).

For better visualization in Alloy Analyzer, please apply theme setting `theme.thm` with the model.
